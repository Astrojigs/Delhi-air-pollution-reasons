# Delhi-air-pollution-reasons
Finding parameters which are the main contributors to cause a rise in Delhi air pollution using QGIS and SQL (PostgreSQL)

# Motivation:

1. Worsening situations leading to unbreathable air in Delhi.

2. Following regions of interests:
- Whether agricultural harvesting in close-by regions affect the overall air quality in Delhi.
- Does Wind direction play an important role in air quality?
- Which month do we see maximum amount of air pollution in Delhi?

# Analysis:
## Data Required:
*Give links to all the Data*
- Fire data
- Climate, wind Data
- Air quality index and particle pollutants measurements Data
- Annual pollution data

## Visualizing Fire Data:
Using GIS software like QGIS we can plot out the fire data from 2019.
